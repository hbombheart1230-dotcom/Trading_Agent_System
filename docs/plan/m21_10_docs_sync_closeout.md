# M21-10: Documentation Sync and Closeout

- Date: 2026-02-15
- Goal: finalize M21 by syncing roadmap/index/tree docs with implemented M21 milestones.

## Scope (minimal)

1. Update roadmap document with concrete M21 implementation status.
2. Update project tree document to include M21 plan artifacts.
3. Update docs index with M21 closeout references.

## Implemented

- File: `docs/en/12_roadmap.md`
  - Added M21 status list (`M21-1` through `M21-10`).

- File: `docs/en/13_project_tree.md`
  - Updated timestamp.
  - Added M21-related document list.

- File: `docs/en/00_index.md`
  - Added M21 start/closeout plan document links.

## Safety Notes

- Documentation-only milestone.
- No runtime code behavior changed.
